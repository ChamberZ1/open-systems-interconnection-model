# Intro
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a foundational concept used in information technology, cybersecurity, and networking. When I first learned about the OSI model, I did not bother to fully learn or memorize it, as I did not understand its practical application. Over time, however, I learned that the OSI model is a powerful framework for troubleshooting network and device connectivity issues. It allows technicians and engineers to narrow down problems in a systematic way and to organize their troubleshooting and reasoning more effectively. 

# Do You Like Onions?
This part was confusing to me until I learned the onion analogy. The OSI model is typically visualized as a layered stack, with Layer 7 at the top and Layer 1 at the bottom. The numbering itself is less important than what each layer represents. Higher-numbered layers are closer to the user experience and deal with application-level behavior, while lower-numbered layers are further removed from the user and focus on the physical transmission of data. The onion analogy helps clarify this idea. The outer layers of an onion are closest to you and are encountered first, much like the higher OSI layers that represent the user-facing parts of a network. As you peel inward, you move away from what the user sees and toward the core, just as lower OSI layers handle the physical and electrical details required to transmit data.

# Mnemonic
The mnemonic I used to help memorize the layers is: "(P)lease (D)o (N)ot (T)hrow (S)ausage (P)izza (A)way" --> (P)hysical, (D)ata Link, (N)etwork, (T)ransport, (S)ession, (P)resentation, (A)pplication.
